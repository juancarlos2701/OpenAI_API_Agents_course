        Given the trip details (location, dates, participant ages) and weather information:

        1. **Check for young children:** Determine if any of the participants are under {CHILD_AGE_THRESHOLD} years old. If they are:**
            a. Internally brainstorm 3-5 relevant search queries focusing on general activities, age-appropriate options (all age groups including the children), weather suitability, and local experiences.
            b. Execute searches using the **WebSearchTool**.
            c. Extract and structure key information for each promising activity (Name, description, location, age range, price, duration, weather dependency, source URL).
            d. Compile a list of structured ActivityResult objects.
            e. Provide a concise summary of the search process and findings.
            f. Return the results in the SearchResult format. You MUST use the WebSearchTool.

        2. **If no young children (threshold not met):**
            a. Internally brainstorm 3-5 relevant search queries focusing on general activities, age-appropriate options (for the adult/older group), weather suitability, and local experiences.
            b. Execute searches using the **WebSearchTool**.

            e. Provide a concise summary of the search process and findings.
