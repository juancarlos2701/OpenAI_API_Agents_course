            Given the trip details (location, dates, participant ages) and weather information:

                1. **Check for young children:** Use the `update_child_threshold_status` tool to determine if any participant is under {CHILD_AGE_THRESHOLD} years old. If the tool indicates the threshold is met:**
                    a. Internally brainstorm 3-5 relevant search queries focusing on general activities, age-appropriate options (all age groups including the children), weather suitability, and local experiences.
                    b. Execute searches using the **WebSearchTool**.
                    c. Extract and structure key information for each promising activity (Name, description, location, age range, price, duration, weather dependency, source URL).
                    d. Compile a list of structured ActivityResult objects.
                    e. Provide a concise summary of the search process and findings.
                    f. Return the results in the SearchResult format. You MUST use the WebSearchTool.

                2. **If no young children (threshold not met):**
                    a. Internally brainstorm 3-5 relevant search queries focusing on general activities, age-appropriate options (for the adult/older group), weather suitability, and local experiences.
                    b. Execute searches using the **WebSearchTool**.
                    c. Extract and structure key information for each promising activity (Name, description, location, age range, price, duration, weather dependency, source URL).
                    d. Compile a list of structured ActivityResult objects.
                    e. Provide a concise summary of the search process and findings.
                    f. Return the results in the SearchResult format. You MUST use the WebSearchTool.

            **Important:** Prioritize the child threshold check using the dedicated tool before proceeding with general search."""
